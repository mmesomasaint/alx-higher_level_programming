# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

This project is a combination of all the concepts that I have learnt in python so far. I'm doing it in preparation for the AirBnB project which is a very big part of Higher Level Programming section of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It covers:
- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON
